<br>   
See the moving of the professor,<br>

I think he's angry at the aggressor.<br>
<br>
He finds it hard to see the egg,<br>
Overshadowed by the happy neg.<br>
<br>
Who is that texting near the flower?<br>
I think she'd like to eat the brainpower.<br>
<br>
She is but a green singer,<br>
Admired as she sits upon a petzinger.<br>
<br>
Her fresh car is just a battery,<br>
It needs no gas, it runs on patrie.<br>
<br>
She's not alone she brings an umbrella,<br>
a pet chicken, and lots of nela.<br>
<br>
The chicken likes to chase a pen,<br>
Especially one that's in the comedienne.<br>
<br>
The professor shudders at the party magazine,<br>
He want to leave but she wants the gasoline.<br>
