<br>
See the moving of the professor, <br>
I think he's angry at the aggressor.<br>
<br>
He finds it hard to see the egg, <br>
Overshadowed by the green meg.<br>
<br>
Who is that sitting near the coke? <br>
I think she'd like to eat the practical joke.<br>
<br>
She is but a red singer, <br>
Admired as she sits upon a gunslinger.<br>
<br>
Her messy car is just a chocolate, <br>
It needs no gas, it runs on chocolat.<br>
<br>
She's not alone she brings a pen, <br>
a pet chicken, and lots of heath hen.<br>
<br>
The chicken likes to chase an apple, <br>
Especially one that's in the snapple.<br>
<br>
The professor shudders at the fresh pasta,<br>
 He want to leave but she wants the asta.<br>

-A Love Poem from My Shopping Mall-<br>
<br>
Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
Comments are hilarious,<br>
And so are you.<br>
<br>
Orchids are white,<br>
Ghost ones are rare,<br>
The path is straight,<br>
And so is your hair.<br>
<br>
Magnolia grows,<br>
With buds like eggs,<br>
Lips are thin,<br>
And so are your legs.<br>
<br>
Sunflowers reach,<br>
Up to the skies,<br>
Algae are green,<br>
And so are your eyes.<br>
<br>
Foxgloves in hedges,<br>
Surround the farms,<br>
The eagle is bald,<br>
And so are your arms.<br>
<br>
Daisies are pretty,<br>
Daffies have style,<br>
An atmosphere is friendly,<br>
And so is your smile.<br>
<br>
A moonlight is beautiful,<br>
Just like you.<br>

-A Haiku about a Panda-<br>
<br>
"The juxtaposition of panda and monkey is truly inspired."<br>
- The Daily Tale<br>
<br>
"I don't like short poems. So why am I reviewing a haiku, you may wonder? Well, I liked the title - 'Panda'. It went down hill from there."<br>
- Enid Kibbler<br>
<br>
"Amazing how so few words can set a scene so perfectly. I close my eyes and all I can see is the ungroomed wintertime."<br>
- Hit the Spoof<br>
<br>
"I felt that I was a panda. It was spooky. I hope to read more by Anonymous. Perhaps next time, something longer."<br>
- Zob Gloop<br>
<br>
"I've always wanted to write a haiku about a panda. I can't belive Anonymous has beaten me to it."<br>
- Betty Borison<br>
<br>
"Ungroomed wintertime is a popular first line for a haiku. It's incredible how much diversity can be achieved with those final lines."<br>
- Chris Critic, otherwise known as Cristic<br>

--Hahaha Hilarious!-<br>
<br>
One day at a grocery shop,<br>
I met a man selling apples,<br>
For money he wanted to swap,<br>
But I really wanted some pineapples.<br>
<br>
"Got any pineapples?" asked I.<br>
"For that's how I'll spend my money."<br>
"No pineapples here!" said the guy.<br>
He seemed to find it quite funny.<br>
<br>
"We've got some lovely pies,<br>
I'll give you a very fine price."<br>
"I'd rather have some ties."<br>
The man blinked rapidly thrice.<br>
<br>
The man seemed exceptionally cute,<br>
And his manner was strangely amused.<br>
He wasn't what I would call subacute,<br>
Great disdain he noticeably oozed.<br>
<br>
Like others, he thought I was odd,<br>
Some say I'm a bit grumpy.<br>
Still he gave me a courteous nod,<br>
As if he thought I was plenty bumpy.<br>
<br>
So in search of my goal I departed,<br>
But before the grocery shop could I leave,<br>
The man came running full-hearted,<br>
"I can help you I believe."<br>
<br>
"Apples, pineapples, you shall find.<br>
Pies, ties, you can get.<br>
You must now open your mind,<br>
And get down to New York Market.<br>
<br>
So to New York Market I decided to go,<br>
In search of the pineapples I craved.<br>
The winds it did eerily blow.<br>
But I felt that the day could be saved.<br>
